description: Run the docs app against your own Guilders API environment
---

## Environment Variables

Set the API origin for OpenAPI ingestion:

```bash
API_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

The docs app loads your OpenAPI schema from:

`$API_URL/openapi/json`

## Local Run

```bash
bun install
bun run dev --filter docs
```

Then visit:

- `/` for written documentation.
- `/api-reference` for generated OpenAPI pages.

## Deployment Notes

- Host docs app as a separate Next.js service.
- Point `API_URL` to your production API base URL.
- Ensure CORS and auth policies allow your docs domain for interactive API testing.
