description: Data entities and relationships in Guilders
---

Guilders centers around `Account` as the primary finance entity, and links synced providers and transactions around it.

## Primary Models

- `Account`
  - Belongs to a user (`user_id`)
  - Carries `type` (`asset` or `liability`) and `subtype` (`depository`, `brokerage`, `crypto`, `property`, `vehicle`, `creditcard`, `loan`, `stock`)
  - Stores `value` and `currency`
  - Uses `institution_connection_id` when synced from a provider
- `Transaction`
  - Belongs to one account (`account_id`)
  - Includes `amount`, `currency`, `date`, `description`, `category`
- `Provider`
  - Data aggregator source (for example Plaid)
- `Institution`
  - Bank/brokerage/exchange connected through a provider
- `ProviderConnection`
  - User-authenticated provider link, includes encrypted secrets
- `InstitutionConnection`
  - Per-institution connection state (including `broken`)

## Relationship Flow

`Provider -> Institution -> ProviderConnection -> InstitutionConnection -> Account -> Transaction`

This is the canonical sync flow when accounts are imported instead of manually created.
