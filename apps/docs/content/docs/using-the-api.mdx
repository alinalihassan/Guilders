## Authentication

All endpoints require authenticated access:

- Web: Better Auth session cookie.
- Mobile and external clients: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
- Some workflows may use `x-api-key` where defined in security schemes.

## Core Endpoints

- `GET /api/account` to list all user accounts.
- `POST /api/account` to create manual accounts.
- `GET /api/transaction` to list transactions (recommended descending by date).
- `POST /api/transaction` to create manual transactions.
- `GET /api/account/:id/transaction` for account-scoped history.

## Example Requests

```bash
curl "$API_URL/api/account" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

```bash
curl "$API_URL/api/transaction?limit=20" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```
