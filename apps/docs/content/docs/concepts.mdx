## Manual vs Synced Accounts

- Manual accounts are user-managed and edited directly.
- Synced accounts come from provider/institution connections.
- `institution_connection_id` on account indicates sync origin.

## Net Worth Semantics

- Asset values contribute positively.
- Liability values reduce total net worth.
- Multi-currency totals should apply conversion before aggregation.

## Transaction Ownership

- Transactions always belong to a single account.
- Recent activity views should include account context.
- Categories and descriptions are metadata, while `amount` and `currency` are authoritative values.

## Connection Health

- Institution connections can become broken (`broken: true`) when credentials expire.
- Clients should surface reconnect flows when connections are broken.
